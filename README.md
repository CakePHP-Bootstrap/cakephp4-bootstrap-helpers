CakePHP 4.x Helpers to generate HTML with @Twitter Boostrap style: `Breadcrumbs`, `Flash`, `Form`, `Html`, `Modal`, `Navbar`,
`Card` and `Paginator` helpers available!

How to... ?
===========

#### Installation

If you want the **Bootstrap 4** version of the plugin:

- Add the plugin to your `composer.json`:

```bash
# Stable version:
composer require holt59/cakephp3-bootstrap-helpers:4.0.3
```

- [Load the helpers](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/views/helpers.html#configuring-helpers) you want in your `View/AppView.php`:

```php
$this->loadHelper('Html', [
    'className' => 'Bootstrap.Html',
    // Other configuration options...
]);
```

#### Breaking changes from previous versions

- `FormHelper`:
  - it is not possible to place error message in a separate column in horizontal form, the error message
  will always be put below the input.

- `NavbarHelper`:
  - the following options of the `create()` methods have been removed or have had their meaning changed:
    - `static` is now `sticky`
    - `responsive` has been dropped and replace by a `collapse` option with the following meaning: `true`
    for always collapsed, `false` for never collapsed, or a string representing indicating when the content
    should collapse (`'lg'` is the default).
    - `fluid` has been dropped.
    - `container` is a new option (`bool`, default is `false`) to indicate if the content of the navbar
    should be wrapped inside a `<div class="container"></div>`.
    - `inverse` has been dropped.
  - a new `theme` option has been added to the `create()` method to control, possible values are `'light'`,
  `'dark'`, `false` (no theme), or an array `[$theme, $bg]`.
  - when adding a `link()` to an inner menu, the `$linkOptions` parameters is not usable anymore and the
  `$options` parameters should be used directly (their are no wrapping `<li>` anymore for inner menu).
